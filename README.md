# LMAE
Create your own Linux Mint Arch Edition.

 # How to create your own "LMAE" - Linux Mint Arch Edition
 
> ## Step 1 - Installing Arch Linux:
>
>> ### 1.1 - Download a Arch ISO
>>
>> You can download the ISO from the offical ArchLinux-website:
>> https://archlinux.org/download/
>
>> ### 1.2 - Flash the ISO with the flash tool of your choice
>> - balenaEtcher
>> - Win32 Disk Imager
>> - Rufus
>
>> ### 1.3 - Boot your Computer with your flashed USB/CD
>
>> ### 1.4 - Set up your keyboard layout
>> You can list available keymaps with:\
>> `ls /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/**/*.map.gz`\
>> Apply the keymap of your choice with:\
>> `loadkeys la-latin1` | Example for the latinamerican spanish keymap
>
>> ### 1.5 - Check if your internet connection is working
>> Ensure your network interface is listed and enabled. You can check this with:\
>> `ip link`
>>
>> In case of a WIFI connection you can use:\
>> `iwctl`
>> And folow the help within the command\
>>
>> Check, if you can establish a connection:\
>> `ping 8.8.8.8`
>
>> ### 1.6 - Update the system clock
>> Ensure the system clock is accurate:\
>> `timedatectl set-ntp true`
>
>> ### 1.7 - Verify the boot mode
>> `ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars`\
>> If the result is "No such file or directory", that means you need to
>> install Arch in BIOS mode. If you get a list of the efivars, you should
>> install Arch in UEFI mode.
>
>> ### 1.8 - Set up your disks
>>> #### 1.8.1 - Locate your disk
>>> List your disks and find the disk on which you want to install LMAE:\
>>> `fdisk -l`\
>>> What we need, is the path of the disk, which you want to use.\
>>> The path should look like `/dev/sda`, `/dev/nvme0n1` or `/dev/mmcblk0`
>>
>>> #### 1.8.2 - Partition your disk
>>> When partitioning I use the GPT partition table. If you want to use another one you have to know the partitioning yourself
>>>
>>> Example layouts:
>>> <center>
>>> UEFI / GPT
>>>
>>> | Mount point | Partition type   | Suggested size             |
>>> |-------------|------------------|----------------------------|
>>> | `/mnt/boot` | EFI System       | 500MB or more              |
>>> | -           | Linux swap       | More than 512 MiB          |
>>> | `/mnt`      | Linux filesystem | the rest of the disk space |
>>>
>>>  BIOS / GPT
>>>
>>> | Mount point | Partition type   | Suggested size             |
>>> |-------------|------------------|----------------------------|
>>> | -           | BIOS boot        | 500MB or more              |
>>> | -           | Linux swap       | More than 512 MiB          |
>>> | `/mnt`      | Linux filesystem | the rest of the disk space |
>>> </center>
>>>
>>> Now open the disk you want to use in "cfdisk". This should look like this:
>>> `cfdisk /dev/sda`\
>>> Now choose "gpt" and press "Enter".\
>>> Then create the partitions depending on whether you have UEFI or BIOS. After that choose the partition type, write the changes and quit "cfdisk".
>>
>>> #### 1.8.3 - Format your disk
>>> Now the created partitions have to be formatted. Here we again differentiate between UEFI and BIOS.
>>>
>>> Example for UEFI:
>>> - `mkswap /dev/sda2` | Format as "Linux swap (swap)"
>>> - `mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3` | Format as "Linux filesystem (ext4)"
>>> - `mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/sda1` | Format as "FAT32"
>>>
>>> Example for BIOS:
>>> - `mkswap /dev/sda2` | Format as "Linux swap (swap)"
>>> - `mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3` | Format as "Linux filesystem (ext4)"
>>
>>> #### 1.8.4 - Mount your disk
>>> First we need to mount our "Linux filesystem" to "/mnt":\
>>> `mount /dev/sda3 /mnt`
>>>
>>> Second we need to mount the "Linux swap":\
>>> `swapon /dev/sda2`
>>> 
>>> If you are using UEFI, we need to create the mount point "/mnt/boot" now and then mount our "EFI System" partition:
>>> - `mkdir /mnt/boot`
>>> - `mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot`
>
>> ### 1.9 - Installation of the base system
>> Now we need to install all the necessary packages to get our system up and running:\
>> `pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware networkmanager grub vim`
>
>> ### 1.10 - Configure the system
>>> #### 1.10.1 - Generate an fstab
>>>
>>> We need to generate an fstab file, which mounts our disks automatically when booting:\
>>> `genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab`
>>
>>> #### 1.10.2 - Change the root to the new system
>>> After that we should change our root to "/mnt":\
>>> `arch-chroot /mnt`
>>
>>> #### 1.10.3 - Set up the system time
>>> To change the timezone, you need to change "Region", with the region and "City" with the of your timezone:\
>>> `ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Region/City /etc/localtime`
>>>
>>> After that we need to sync the system time with the hardware clock
>>> `hwclock --systohc`
>>
>>> #### 1.10.4 - Create the localization
>>> - Edit "/etc/locale.gen" with your favourite editor and uncomment the locals which you want to use. You should also uncomment "en_US.UTF-8".
>>> - To generate the locales simply run `locale-gen`
>>> - Create the file "/etc/locale.conf" and define your preferred locale in the file. Example: `LANG=en_US.UTF-8`
>>> - The last step is to create the file "/etc/vconsole.conf". In this file we need to set our keyboard layout. We do this by adding the line: `KEYMAP=de-latin1` instead of "de-latin1" you have to insert your preferred keyboard layout.
>>
>>> #### 1.10.5 - Network configuration
>>> - Create and edit the file "/etc/hostname". Choose a computer name and insert it.
>>> - Now create the file "/etc/hosts" and insert the following:\
>>> "computername" should be the name you set before in the "/etc/hostname" file
>>>
>>>       127.0.0.1      localhost
>>>       ::1            localhost
>>>       127.0.1.1      computername
>>
>>> #### 1.10.6 - Set the root password
>>> To change the root password, you simply type:\
>>> `passwd`\
>>> Now just set a new password.
>
>> ### 1.11 - Configuring the GRUB boot loader
>> Again, if you want to install a different bootloader, you have to do this yourself, as I will only explain GRUB.
>>> #### 1.11.1 - Set up GRUB with BIOS
>>> - grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sda
>>
>>> #### 1.11.2 - Set up GRUB with UEFI
>>> - grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=esp --bootloader-id=GRUB
>>
>>> #### 1.11.3 - Enable microcode updates
>>> Intel-CPU: `pacman -S intel-ucode`\
>>> AMD-CPU: `pacman -S amd-ucode`
>>
>>> #### 1.11.4 - Generate the grub configuraton
>>> - grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
>
>> ### 1.12 - Loading the new System
>> - Exit the chroot environment by typing: `exit`
>> - Unmount the partitions: `umount -R /mnt`
>> - Boot into the new installed System: `reboot now`\
>> Make sure your installation medium is disconnected before booting.
>> - Log in to the new system using username "root" and your password.
>
>> ### 1.13 - Important changes to the new system
>> - Enable "NetworkManager":
>>
>>       systemctl enable --now NetworkManager

> ## Step 2 - Setting up the desktop environment:
>> ### 2.1 - Adding a system user
>> We need to create a system user for cinnamon. You can create one and set his password by executing the following:\
>> `useradd -m username` | Replace "username" with the name you want to use. \
>> `passwd username` | Replace "username" with the name you used before.
>
>> ### 2.2 - Installing the desktop environment
>> - First, we need to download the necessary packages:\
>> `pacman -S xorg xorg-apps xorg-drivers mesa cinnamon gnome-terminal`
>> - Later, we'll install "lightdm", to open our desktop:
>> - The last step is to login to our desktop using the password of the user we created before.
>
>> ### 2.3 - Changing the keyboard layout
>> - Navigate to "cinnamon menu -> keyboard -> layouts"
>> - Set the keyboard layout of your choice by adding it at the bottem left (+) and delete the default (-)
>
>> ### 2.4 - Set up sudo
>> - Install sudo using: `pacman -S sudo`
>> - Open the Terminal and login as root using: `su`
>> - Type `EDITOR=vim visudo`, to open the "sudoers"-file.
>> - Under "User privilege specification" we should add our user. This should look like:
>>
>>       ##
>>       ## User privilege specification
>>       ##
>>       root ALL=(ALL) ALL
>>       username ALL=(ALL) ALL
>>
>> - Save and close the file.
>> - Now change back to the user account with: `su username`
>> - Sudo is now set up and ready to use.
>
>> ### 2.5 - Activating the AUR
>> To use the AUR, we need to install yay:
>> - `sudo pacman -S git base-devel` | Install necessary packages.
>> - `cd ~` | Change directory to the users home.
>> - `git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git` | Download yay.
>> - `cd yay` | Change directory to the folder we have downloaded.
>> - `makepkg -si` | Build package and install yay.
>> - `cd ..`| Go back to the home directory.
>> - `rm -rf ./yay/` | Delete the yay-folder.
>> - `yay -Syy` | Make sure yay is working and sync the package database.
>
>> ### 2.6 - Making cinnamon look like on Linux Mint
>>> #### 2.6.1 - Installing the Fonts
>>> - `yay -S noto-fonts noto-fonts-emoji`
>>> - Navigate to "cinnamon menu -> Font Selection" and change it to the following:
>>>
>>> <center>
>>>
>>> |                   | Font              | Size |
>>> |-------------------|-------------------|------|
>>> | Default font      | Ubuntu Regular    | 10   |
>>> | Desktop font      | Ubuntu Regular    | 10   |
>>> | Document font     | Sans Regular      | 10   |
>>> | Monospace font    | Monospace Regular | 10   |
>>> | Window title font | Ubuntu Medium     | 10   |
>>>
>>> </center>
>>>
>>
>>> #### 2.6.2 - Installing the Mint-Themes and icons
>>> - `yay -S mint-themes mint-l-themes mint-y-icons mint-x-icons mint-l-icons`
>>> - Navigate to "cinnamon mennu -> Themes" and choose the mint themes, which you want to use."
>>> - If you want to use the full "Linux Mint experience", you can install them by executing: `yay -S mint-backgrounds mint-artwork`\
>>> Then just choose your favourite at "cinnamon menu -> Backgrounds"
>
